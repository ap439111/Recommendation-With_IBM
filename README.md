# Recommendation with IBM

## Introduction

For this project I have analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles they might like.

The project is divided into the following tasks

### I. Exploratory Data Analysis

The data provided by IBM Watson studio is explored in this section. The basic questions and answers about the data is explored in detail at the notebook.

### II. Rank Based Recommendations

The most popular articles based on the most user-article interactions are recoomended to the users using this recommendation technique. All the details are explained in the notebook.

### III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

In order to build better recommendations for the users of IBM's platform, we looked at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users. This would be a step in the right direction towards more personal recommendations for the users. I have implemented it in this section of the notebook.

### IV. Matrix Factorization

In this section of the notebook, a machine learning approach is used to building recommendations . Using the user-item interactions, a matrix decomposition is built. Using the decomposition, an idea of how well the predictions can be made is explored in this section.

All the details of the steps are explanied in the notebok.
